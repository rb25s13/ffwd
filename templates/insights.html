                <p style="font-size:20px;">Wildfires not only affect our environment but also affect our air quality, destorys thousands of homes, and take away lives (human and animals).
                Wildfires most often happen quickly and without warning.

                Below is a picture of The Rockhouse Fire from 2011 around the Fort Davis area in west Texas. This fire started from an electrical short in an abandoned building and ended up burning roughly 63 acres **per minute**! In total, this fire burned 20,800 acres in roughly 5.5 hours with an average speed of 6mph. 
                The average human can run 8-10 mph but cannot keep up the pace for 5.5 hours much like this fire did.

                We all know that children can be rotten and destructive (semi-kidding), but what we didn't know is that they cause almost the same amount of wildfires as campfires do!

                In 2011, Texas saw a massive influx of fires due to a serious drought. Roughly 3.5 million acres were burned throughout 2011 with the leading cause being “Equipment Use” with "Arson" trailing close behind as the second leading cause.  
                <br>

                <br>
                As you can see, in 2011, Texas had burned roughly 3.5 MILLION acres which is almost the same size as state of Connecticut (3.54 mil acres)!! 
                <ul>
                    <li>1992-1999 (7 year span) = 425,487 acres / 7yrs = 105,336 average acres burned per year</li>
                    <li>2000-2007 (7 year span) = 2,683,265 acres / 7yrs = 383,324 average acres burned per year</li>
                    <li>2008-2015 (7 year span) = 6,365,597 acres / 7yrs = 909,371 average acres burned per year</li>
                </ul>
                
                
                <br>
                <br>

                <br>
                <br>
                From the graph, you can definitely see a correlation between the amount of precipitation (or lack there of) and the amount of wildfires. 
                <br>

                There is a massive count of miscellaneous and unidentified wildfire causes (we can still blame the children), but lightening seems to be the leading cause of the amount of acres being burned in Texas with the runner up being equipment use. 
                <br>

                <h1>Our Recommendations</h1>
                - Arson appears to be a consistent cause of wildfires in Texas. The current maximum penalty for arson resulting in severe injury or death is equivalent to possessing 4 to 200 grams of cocaine. (Both result in a fine of up to $10,000 and a max of 10 years in prison.) The department might consider partnering with law enforcement and lawmakers to increase the maximum sentence for arson. 
                - Since 2008, 'equipment use' has maintained the leading cause of wildfires in Texas. Activities under this category include (but not limited to) the use of lawnmowers, weed-eaters, chain saws, grinders, welders, tractors, and construction machinery.  We strongly suggest that the department educate communities in high-risk regions on how to operate equipment safely along with making annual inspections of equipement mandetory. Currently, the only inspection regulation for equipement use is from the manufacterer and no inspections are required after.
